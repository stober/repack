Repack

For any list of Python modules

pymod1
pymod2
pymod3

make it easy to install them in a new namespace. So to get

import pymod1
import pymod2
import pymod3

you have to instead do the following

import meta.pymod1 as pymod1
import meta.pymod2 as pymod2
import meta.pymod3 as pymod3

E.g. All the modules are installed in a new (module) namespace "meta".

At the moment the scope of repackage is limited to source projects on Github that use distutils (my personal use case). Other packaging mechanisms are not supported.

Included is a script that takes as input a new repackage name and a git_config file containing locations of github repositories for the source of distutil projects. The script constructs a new project in a directory

<repackage name>

such that if you run setup.py in that directory you will install all the github projects in your repackage namespace.
